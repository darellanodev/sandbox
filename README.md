# Sandbox

This is a repository with little examples that I made to help me to do small things to incorporate them in my other personal projects

## Github repository

- <https://github.com/darellanodev/sandbox>

### go-ebitengine directory

This directory contains examples using the Go programming language with the Ebitengine library. It includes:

- `embed`: Demonstrates how to embed fonts (.ttf), sounds (.wav), images (.png), and text files (.txt) for use with Go and Ebitengine. This is especially important when building for the web, as loading external files may cause errors. Embedding resources is also a more efficient approach.

- `img_transformations`: Demonstrates how to flip images, display sprites at their actual scale, and understand the coordinate system.

### pygame-ce directory

This directory contains examples using Python with the Pygame Community Edition library. It includes:

- `particles`: Demonstrates a simple particle emission system. Move the mouse and click to stop the emission.
