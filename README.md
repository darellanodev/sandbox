# Sandbox

This is a repository with little examples that I made to help me to do small things to incorporate them in my other personal projects

## How to use

- Clone the repository
- Open the desired subfolder into VSCode, for example `go_ebitengine_01_embed`
- Run with `go run .`

## List

- `go_ebitengine_01_embed`: It shows how to embed fonts (.ttf), sounds (.wav), images (.png), and text files (.txt) to use with go and ebitengine. Its important when building for web because I got errors when loading external files and also this embed mechanism is most efficient.
- `go_ebitengine_02_flip_sprite`: It shows how to flip images, how to display the real sprite scale and understand coordinate system.
